# This is just a place to keep track of files that will get changed, but
# where we don't want to track the changes, even though we need the file
# in the repo.
#
# NB:  This is just a file for dumb humans.  Git doesn't know about it.
#
# To add a file
#
#   git update-index --assume-unchanged <file>
#
# to make a change to an "untracked file"
#
#   git update-index --no-assume-unchanged <file>
# commit changes, then issue the assume-unchanged again
