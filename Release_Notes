The purpose of this document is to allow users to more efficiently track and understand changes made to the DANCE Analysis software.


Version 3.0.0 - Start of the release notes.  Added the caen2018 data format to the unpacker.  Requires a statement of 'DataFormat caen2018' or 'DataFormat caen2015' to be placed in the .cfg file.  

Version 3.0.1 - Minor efficieny upgrades to waveform unpacking in the caen2018 data format.

Version 3.1.0 - Changed the way the Crystal and DEvent Blocking Times are done.  Before this change the last_timestamp variable in each respective case was updated regardless of the event being valid or invalid.  This is incorrect because a blocked entry or event should not be recorded in the first place and thus the timestamp shouldn't update.

Version 3.1.1 - Added unpacking of 0x8500 + 4n diagnostic register in the scalers

Version 3.1.2 - Added checking of bit 26 (CAEN Board Fail Bit) in the second board aggregate header word.  Result is a warning if it is found high.  Also removed unpacking of channelmask2 since it does not make sense with the data format of our hardware.

Version 3.1.3 - Added time between beam monitor events to look into possible dead time for beam monitors

Version 3.1.4 - Fixed #define statements in the scaler part of the caen2018 unpacker.  They were outside of brackets of for loops causing the code to not compile when #define ScalerVerbose was off

Version 3.2.0 - Added output txt file for diagnostics information in caen2018 format.

Version 3.3.0 - Changed DANCE, U235, and Li6 flight path lengths and time offsets.

Version 3.4.0 - Added waveform hisograms for all IDs in one TH3I. X_Y_Z SampleNumber_WaveformValue_ID.  Also added the hID_Raw spectrum which fills the number of counts for each channel +board*16 up to 256 (14 boards).  This aids in debugging the channel drop problem for non dance crystal channels.  Slight changes to the order of output root file creation in main.cpp

Version 3.4.1 - Changed the location of the Q-Value gates to the .cfg file for stage 1. Hardcoded maximum of 10 Q-value gates.  Can't imagine a reasonable scenario where someone needs more.  To change this the number of TH3F histograms needs to be changed and the array size of QGates in main.cpp needs to be changed. 

Version 3.4.2 - Added the path for the TimeDeviations and Calibrations to global.h and moved the folders one directory back for my version of the code.

Version 3.5.0 - Changed the unpacker to reflect the new caen2018 data format with the "user extras" word and the placeholders for the vme and hv event types. 

Version 4.0.0 - Added the ability to run simulated data through the analysis.  More features added to hCrID_Diagnostics in utilities.

Version 4.1.0 - Added the vme scalers to the unpacker for both caen2015 and caen2018 formats. Scaler description file is now in the Config directory.

Version 4.1.1 - Changed the verobosity flags for scalers adding on for diagnostics. 

Version 5.0.0 - Changed the way the main is invoked removing extra command line options.  For Stage0: \"./DANCE_Analysis pathtodata runnumber cfgfile.cfg \",for Stage1: \"./DANCE_Analysis runnumber cfgfile.cfg \" and for Simulations: \"./DANCE_Analysis cfgfile.cfg \".  Minor changes in unpacker so variables that dont matter at a particular stage are not output to screen.

Version 5.1.0 - Changed the time deviations such that it looks for a wider window for the mean and progressively closes in.  It was possible for low stats channels with larger backgrounds that it missed entirely.   

Version 5.2.0 - Changed the gates slightly. First one checks to see if it is in the alpha gate then if not checks to see if its in the gamma gate.  Should be a minor performace improvement and allow for a gamma gate that overlaps with the alpha gate.     

Version 5.2.0 - Fixed coding error in analyzer.cpp and changed the range of ADC_calib and ADC_calib_invalid from 800,0,16,1000,0,10 to 2400,0,24,800,0,8.

Version 5.2.1 - Made some of the diagnostics such as Waveform Histograms and Detector Load enabled or disabled via #defines. 

Version 6.0.0 - Changed the stage1 analysis commands again.  Since I have been making an automated DANCE analysis on hygelac.  The command is identical to stage0 but pathtodata needs to point to a binary file directory.  The sym link to stage0_bin is still needed for the output of stage0. 

Version 6.0.1 - Changed the order of the else if statements in stage0 unpacking such that it takes the most probable types first.  Data (1), Diagnostics (8), Scalers (2), then begin and end of runs.  Should be an efficiency improvement. 

Version 7.0.0 - Changed the energy calculation for the slow integral.  It is now the same as it is in the caen2015 unpacker where the short gate is subtracted from the long gate.  This is important because the alphas and gammas have differing amounts of light in the slow components and thus the gain extracted from the alpha calibrator on the caen2018 data was inconsistent with the caen2015.  

Version 7.0.1 - Removed the cout statements in the Make_Time_Deviations function.  These were just adding more lines of output for the automated analysis on hugelac with no real benefit. 

Version 7.0.1 - Fixed a coding error filling the hID_Raw histogram and added beam monitor waveform histograms
