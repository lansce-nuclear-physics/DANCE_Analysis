The purpose of this document is to explain how the program works.


1) Prerequisites 

   One will need to make symbolic links for:
   'stage0_root' (the location of the root output from stage 0), 
   'stage0_bin' (the location of the binary output from stage 0 and the input for stage 1), 
   'stage1_root' (the location of the root output from stage 1), and 
   'stage1_bin' (if wanted the binary output from stage 1)

   There also needs to be a symbolic link or local directory containing MIDAS data

   Compile the code by typing make.  


2) Running the DANCE Analysis 

   The code is invoked by the following command and arguments:

   "./DANCE_Analysis /pathtodata runnumber cfgfile.cfg"
   
   The argument 'pathtodata' is either a symbolic link to the location or the location of the .mid or .mid.gz files. 

   The runnumber is padded with 6 zeros and other padding formats would need require a minor change in main.cpp

   Sample .cfg files are included when you clone the package and can be modified thereafter.


3) What Stage 0 does

   Stage 0 is responsible for unpacking and time sorting the data from either MIDAS format and performing analysis on the waveforms.  A variety of diagnostic histograms are made, time deviations are calculated, and a output binary file of the salient quantities of the data is produced.  These quantities are Ifast (the fast or short integral from the PSD firmware), Islow (the slow or long integral from the PSD firmware), the Time-Of-Flight (this is a bit of a misnomer because its actually the 31 bits of the trigger timestamp + the 16 bits (shifted up 31 bits) of the extended time stamp + the CFD timestamp from the waveform analysis), and the ID obtained from mapping the board and channel with the DANCE map.


4) Whate Stage 1 does

   Stage 1 is responsible for physics analysis.  The binary format written by stage 0 is read in and events are built for DANCE, T0, and the beam monitors.  More to come on this later.
